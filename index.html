        How can you protect yourself? By following these five steps:
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>01.</strong> Clean your hands often. Wash your hands with sopa and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after being in a public place or coughing and sneezing. Rinsing your hands doesn't cut it.
        <br>
        <strong>02.</strong> Avoid close contact. We are in our homes for a reason! Avoid contact not only with those who are sick, but everyone not in your household. It might be tempting to sneak out and see your friends, but we have to social distance for the safety of others.
        <br>
        <strong>03.</strong> Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others. You can spread COVID-19 even if you don't feel sick.
        <br>
        <strong>04.</strong> Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue if you are at home. Throw used tissues in the trash and immediately wash your hands.
        <br>
        <strong>05.</strong> Clean and disinfect frequently touches surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toielets, faucets, and sinks.
